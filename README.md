# Prometheus

prometheus is a digital image archive for Art and Cultural Sciences. prometheus
enables the convenient search for images on a common user interface within
different image archives, variable databases from institutes, research
facilities and museums.

The prometheus digital image archive software is the driving force behind the
prometheus image archive.  It's being developed since late fall of 2006, on top
of the Ruby on Rails framework. It is Free Software, released under the terms of
the GNU Affero General Public License.

The application code is curently undergoing extensive refactoring. But you'll
find it here soon. For the moment, we've decided to make the code available to
you as a tarball which you can downlad here:
